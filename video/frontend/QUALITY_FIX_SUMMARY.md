# Video Quality Selection Fix - Summary

## Problem
The video player was not showing all available video qualities from the HLS master.m3u8 manifest. The master manifest contains multiple quality levels (1080p, 720p, 480p, 360p) but they weren't being displayed in the quality selection menu.

## Root Cause
1. The quality menu was only showing qualities from the API endpoint `/api/transcode/${videoHash}/qualities`
2. The HLS manifest qualities were not being extracted and added to the available qualities list
3. No "Auto" (adaptive) quality option was available
4. Quality switching was reloading the entire video instead of using HLS.js level switching

## Solution

### 1. Extract Qualities from HLS Manifest (`useVideoPlayer.js`)

Added code in the `MANIFEST_PARSED` event handler to extract all quality levels from the HLS manifest:

```javascript
hls.on(Hls.Events.MANIFEST_PARSED, (event, data) => {
  // Extract quality levels from HLS manifest
  if (hls.levels && hls.levels.length > 0) {
    const hlsQualities = {};
    
    hls.levels.forEach((level, index) => {
      let qualityName = level.name || level.attrs?.NAME;
      
      if (!qualityName) {
        const height = level.height;
        if (height) {
          qualityName = `${height}p`;
        } else {
          qualityName = `Level ${index}`;
        }
      }
      
      hlsQualities[qualityName] = {
        resolution: qualityName,
        width: level.width,
        height: level.height,
        bitrate: level.bitrate,
        bandwidth: level.attrs?.BANDWIDTH,
        codecs: level.attrs?.CODECS,
        frameRate: level.attrs?.['FRAME-RATE'],
        levelIndex: index
      };
    });
    
    // Update qualities state with HLS levels
    setQualities(prev => ({
      ...prev,
      qualities: {
        ...prev.qualities,
        ...hlsQualities
      },
      hlsLevels: hls.levels
    }));
  }
});
```

### 2. Added Level Switching Event Listener (`useVideoPlayer.js`)

Added `LEVEL_SWITCHED` event to track when quality changes:

```javascript
hls.on(Hls.Events.LEVEL_SWITCHED, (_event, data) => {
  if (hls.levels && hls.levels[data.level]) {
    const level = hls.levels[data.level];
    const qualityName = level.name || `${level.height}p`;
    console.log('[hls] Now playing quality:', qualityName, level);
  }
});
```

### 3. Improved Quality Switching (`useVideoPlayer.js`)

Updated `changeQuality` function to use HLS.js level switching instead of reloading:

```javascript
const changeQuality = (quality) => {
  const hls = hlsInstanceRef.current;
  
  // If HLS is active, use HLS API directly for instant switching
  if (hls && hls.levels && hls.levels.length > 0) {
    if (quality === 'auto') {
      hls.currentLevel = -1; // -1 means auto (adaptive)
      setAutoQualityEnabled(true);
    } else {
      const levelIndex = findLevelIndex(quality);
      if (levelIndex >= 0) {
        hls.currentLevel = levelIndex;
        setAutoQualityEnabled(false);
      }
    }
    setSelectedQuality(quality);
    setShowQualityMenu(false);
    return;
  }
  
  // Fallback: reload video with new quality
  // ... existing reload logic ...
};
```

### 4. Added "Auto" Quality Option (`VideoPlayerControls.jsx`)

Modified `getSortedQualities()` to include an "Auto" option:

```javascript
const getSortedQualities = () => {
  // ... extract qualities from data structure ...
  
  // Add "Auto" option at the beginning if there are qualities available
  if (sortedQualityList.length > 0) {
    sortedQualityList.unshift({
      quality: 'auto',
      meta: { resolution: 'Auto (Adaptive)' },
      resolutionValue: Infinity // Ensure it stays at the top
    });
  }
  
  return sortedQualityList;
};
```

### 5. Enhanced Data Structure Handling (`VideoPlayerControls.jsx`)

Improved quality data extraction to handle multiple formats and exclude internal keys:

```javascript
if (qualities.qualities && typeof qualities.qualities === 'object') {
  qualityData = qualities.qualities;
} else if (Array.isArray(qualities)) {
  // Convert array format to object
  qualities.forEach(q => {
    if (typeof q === 'string') {
      qualityData[q] = { resolution: q };
    } else if (q && q.quality) {
      qualityData[q.quality] = q;
    }
  });
} else if (typeof qualities === 'object') {
  // Direct object with quality keys (excluding master and hlsLevels)
  Object.entries(qualities).forEach(([key, value]) => {
    if (key !== 'master' && key !== 'hlsLevels') {
      qualityData[key] = value;
    }
  });
}
```

### 6. Added Debug Logging

Added comprehensive logging throughout the quality detection and switching process:
- Quality data fetched from API
- Qualities extracted from HLS manifest
- Quality selection changes
- Level switching events

## Benefits

1. **All qualities are now visible**: The quality menu shows all available qualities from the HLS manifest
2. **Instant quality switching**: Uses HLS.js level switching API for seamless quality changes without reloading
3. **Auto quality option**: Users can enable adaptive quality selection based on network conditions
4. **Better debugging**: Comprehensive logging helps diagnose quality-related issues
5. **Robust data handling**: Handles multiple data structure formats from different sources

## Testing

To test the fix:

1. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
2. Open a video in the player
3. Click the quality settings button (three dots icon)
4. Verify you see:
   - "Auto (Adaptive)" option at the top
   - All available qualities (1080p, 720p, 480p, 360p)
5. Select different qualities and verify:
   - Quality switches instantly without reloading
   - Video continues from the same position
   - Console logs show the quality change
6. Select "Auto" and verify:
   - Player adapts quality based on network conditions
   - Console shows automatic quality adjustments

## HLS Master Manifest Example

The master.m3u8 file structure that is now properly parsed:

```
#EXTM3U
#EXT-X-VERSION:3
#EXT-X-INDEPENDENT-SEGMENTS
#EXT-X-STREAM-INF:BANDWIDTH=6592000,AVERAGE-BANDWIDTH=5992000,RESOLUTION=1920x1080,FRAME-RATE=30,CODECS="avc1.640028,mp4a.40.2",NAME="1080p"
1080p/playlist.m3u8
#EXT-X-STREAM-INF:BANDWIDTH=4060000,AVERAGE-BANDWIDTH=3660000,RESOLUTION=1280x720,FRAME-RATE=30,CODECS="avc1.640028,mp4a.40.2",NAME="720p"
720p/playlist.m3u8
#EXT-X-STREAM-INF:BANDWIDTH=2028000,AVERAGE-BANDWIDTH=1728000,RESOLUTION=854x480,FRAME-RATE=30,CODECS="avc1.640028,mp4a.40.2",NAME="480p"
480p/playlist.m3u8
#EXT-X-STREAM-INF:BANDWIDTH=1196000,AVERAGE-BANDWIDTH=996000,RESOLUTION=640x360,FRAME-RATE=30,CODECS="avc1.640028,mp4a.40.2",NAME="360p"
360p/playlist.m3u8
```

All four quality levels (1080p, 720p, 480p, 360p) are now extracted and displayed in the quality menu.
