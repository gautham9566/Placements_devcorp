python manage.py create_test_data --applications 100
```

### Frontend Setup:
```bash
# Install any new dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Run tests
npm test
```

## 🎯 Success Criteria

At the end of implementation, you should have:

✅ **Working Applications Dashboard**: Admin can view, search, and filter all applications  
✅ **Export Functionality**: Can export filtered applications in CSV, Excel, and PDF formats  
✅ **Dynamic Forms**: Job postings can configure which profile fields to collect  
✅ **Application Management**: Admin can view, edit, and manage individual applications  
✅ **Enhanced Job Details**: "View Applications" button now works and shows application list  
✅ **Responsive Design**: Interface works smoothly on all devices with horizontal/vertical scrolling  
✅ **Performance**: System handles 1000+ applications efficiently  

## 🚨 Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Don't skip testing**: Write tests as you go, not at the end
2. **Don't ignore performance**: Test with realistic data volumes
3. **Don't forget mobile**: Test responsive design early and often
4. **Don't overlook accessibility**: Include ARIA labels and keyboard navigation
5. **Don't rush export functionality**: PDF generation can be tricky
6. **Don't ignore error handling**: Plan for network failures and edge cases
